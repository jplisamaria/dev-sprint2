# 3 Ideas for Simple Apps
# -----------------------
	1.	Simple app that executes a line of Python, using 'exec' instead of 'eval'.
	2.	Video player
	3.	Nickname generator a la Pale Kids (characters from Disney's Recess).  The Pale Kids call each other nicknames by spelling their names backwards.  eg. Frank becomes Knarf, and TJ becomes JT.
